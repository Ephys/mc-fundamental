## Features

**Named Lodestone Compass**

![A lodestone named using a sign](docs/screenshots/named-lodestone.png)

You can name your lodestones by placing a sign on them

Binding your compass to the lodestone will automatically name it 
using the text from the sign, instead of "Lodestone Compass".

*Bonus*: Right clicking the sign instead of the Lodestone will also work.

**Crafting Tables**

Enjoy our large selection of crafting tables, now available in all vanilla colors.

*Tip*: custom crafting tables can be crafting into regular crafting tables. Mainly as a workaround for recipes that demand a vanilla table.

**Slime on piston**

You can place slime on a piston by right-clicking slime on a piston face.

You can also use an axe to scrape that slime off. (You don't get the slimeball back).

**Bound Lodestone**

The Bound Lodestone acts like a Lodestone, but is attuned to another lodestone in the world.

Use a Lodestone Compass on an unbound Lodestone to attune it to the same coordinates.

Once a Bound Lodestone has been attuned,
use a regular Compass on the Bound Lodestone to attune it to Lodestone that the Bound Lodestone is attuned to.

*tl;dr* it's a lodestone proxy

You can get it from your local Cartographer
